#### Additional Materials to help on the __<the hard way>__ book Exercise 23

1. Read about Flow Chart on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart

You could try to sketch some flow chart on paper with a pen, before you write long code with complex logic.

2. How does a CPU work?

Even for today's modern Computer, the CPU still works kind of like before, in that it can only do __Adding__ and __Jumping__. You might wonder how does it then do other math operations?

Find out by Google search or YouTube videos.

3. Read about Turing Machine or watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3keLeMwfHY

Then find out is it the same as _von Neumann architecture_?

4. Read about ASCII, UTF-8, or Unicode on Wikipedia.

5. Try this to learn about Binary, http://www.binarymath.info/

And search more to learn about Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal.
